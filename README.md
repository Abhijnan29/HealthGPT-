# Unique Solution Offered Our Project

HealthGPT+ is the platform where we provide every possible day-to-day health need and constant assistance which is user-friendly.

We provide mental health assistance, 24/7. This can be critical to those living in rural areas where mental health resources are scarce or for people experiencing a crisis in the middle of the night when “human help” is not available.

HealthGPT+ can use information about the patient’s condition and insurance information to schedule appointments faster and better.

Our customized Chatbot can ask patients questions to assess symptoms. This is especially helpful if the patient is too sick to get out of bed. We will also provide a reminder feature to assist the patient to take medicine.

We have also come up with our customized medical store for every individual’s day-to-day needs at a minimal rate in comparison to the current market value. Quick home delivery access is also supported by the team.

Every doctor has different sections for treatment, here HealthGPT+ provides suitable doctors to treat particular diseases within the nearby location.
